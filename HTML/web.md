## 1. How does the web work?

A **website is a collection of web pages** which store information in form of text, pictures, videos, animation, or any other form. A website needs a  hosting server to host it or store its data. The domain name is basically the name of the website which helps a user to find the address of the website. And below is the whole process for the functioning of a site :-

1. A user enters a domain name into the search bar of the browser.
1. The browser passes the request to the DNS Server which converts the domain name into the IP address of the site.
1. Then DNS Server passes the request to the main server where the website is stored.
1. And the main server now sends the response to the web browser or to the user.
1. The user is now able to view the site.

## 2. HTTP :-

The **Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)** is the foundation of the World Wide Web, and is used to load webpages using hypertext links. **HTTP** is an application layer protocol designed to transfer information between networked devices and runs on top of other layers of the network protocol stack. A typical flow over **HTTP** involves a client machine making a request to a server, which then sends a response message.

### What is in an HTTP request?
An **HTTP request** is the way Internet communications platforms such as web browsers ask for the information they need to load a website.

Each **HTTP request** made across the Internet carries with it a series of encoded data that carries different types of information. A typical HTTP request contains:

1. HTTP version type.
1. a URL.
1. an HTTP method.
1. HTTP request headers.
1. Optional HTTP body.

## 3. Web Servers :-
 A **web server is software and hardware that uses HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) **and other protocols** to respond to client requests made over the World Wide Web. The main job of a web server is to **display website content** through storing, processing and delivering webpages to users.

 ### Examples of web server uses :-
Web servers often come as part of a larger package of internet- and intranet-related programs that are used for:

1. sending and receiving emails.
1. downloading requests for File Transfer Protocol (FTP) files.
1. building and publishing webpages.

 ## 4. DNS :-
The **Domain Name System (DNS) is the phonebook of the Internet**. Humans access information online through domain names, like *nytimes.com* or *espn.com*. **Web browsers interact through Internet Protocol (IP) addresses**. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources.

Each device connected to the Internet has a unique IP address which other machines use to find the device. DNS servers eliminate the need for humans to memorize IP addresses such as 192.168.1.1 (in IPv4), or more complex newer alphanumeric IP addresses such as 2400:cb00:2048:1::c629:d7a2 (in IPv6).

### How does DNS work?
The process of DNS resolution involves **converting a hostname (such as www.example.com) into a computer-friendly IP address (such as 192.168.1.1)**. An IP address is given to each device on the Internet, and that address is necessary to find the appropriate Internet device <br>- like a street address is used to find a particular home. When a user wants to load a webpage, a translation must occur between what a user types into their web browser (example.com) and the machine-friendly address necessary to locate the example.com webpage.
