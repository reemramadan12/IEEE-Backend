# 1. What is RDBMS?

- RDBMS stands for Relational Database Management System.
- RDBMS is the basis for all modern database systems.
---
## RDBMS Example systems :-
1. PostgreSQL
1. MySQL
1. Microsoft SQL Server
1. Oracle
1. Microsoft Access

# 2. RDBMS vs. DBMS :-

**DBMS** or **Database Management System** is software used to identify, manage, and create a database that provides administered access to the data. In **DBMS**, the data is stored as a file, whereas in **RDBMS**, data is stored in the form of tables. [RDBMS vs. DBMS.](https://byjus.com/gate/difference-between-dbms-and-rdbms/#:~:text=DBMS%20stands%20for%20Database%20Management,in%20the%20form%20of%20tables.)

# 3. What Is PostgreSQL?
- It's the most advanced open-source relational database out there.
- It's an object-relational database management system **(ORDMBS)**, which means that it has relational capabilities and an object-oriented design. [PostgreSQL.](https://www.postgresql.org/)
---
## What Does Object-Relational Database Mean?
An object-relational database **(ORD)** is a database management system **(DBMS)** thatâ€™s composed of both a relational database **(RDBMS)** and an object-oriented database **(OODBMS)**.

# 4. PostgreSQL Clients :-
Postgres can be connected from a programming language, a CLI tool or a GUI. Postgres follows the Client Server architecture where the server listens to requests from the client and returns a response.

---
## Some of the popular client applications for PostgreSQ :-

- **pg_dump** - Extracting database into a file.
- **pg_restore** - Restoring a database from a file.
- **create_db** - Create a new PostgreSQL database.
- **create_user** - Create a new PostgreSQL user account.
- **psql** - Interactive terminal.

# 5. What purpose does pgAdmin serve in PostgreSQL?
 - pgAdmin is the leading open source management tool for PostgreSQL.
 - It provides a powerful graphical interface that simplifies the creation, maintenance, and use of database objects.

 # 6. Naming conventions :-
 for example, when we name **RDBMS** we should always remember that consistency is the best approach.

 ## some of the most importants rules :-
1. Use lowercase names. e.g. user, username
1. If the name of the table or column must consist of more than one word, use an underscore(_) to connect them(i.e. snake_case). e.g. user_account
1. Use UPPERCASE for SQL keywords (e.g. SELECT, INSERT) and built-in functions (e.g. LOWER(), COUNT()).
1. Avoid use of dots, spaces, or dashes in database, schema, table, or column names.
1. When naming objects, balance the objective of keeping names short and easy to use with the objective of making names as descriptive as possible. When in doubt, choose the more descriptive name, because the objects in the database may be used by many people over a period of time. For example use payment_due_date instead of pmdd.

# 7. Constraints in PostgreSQL:-
- **Constraints** are a way to tell Postgres which kinds of data can be inserted into tables, columns, or rows.
- **Constraints** give you as much control over the data in your tables as you wish. If a user attempts to store data in a column that would violate a constraint, an error is raised. This applies even if the value came from the default value definition.
[To know more about constraints and their types.](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-constraints.html)
---
# 8. Indexing in PostgreSQL:-
- **Indexing** is a data structure -B+Tree mostly- that you build and assign on top of an existing table that looks through your table, tries to anaylize it and summarize it so it can create kind of a shortcut. Basically, **Indexing** are a common way to enhance database performance.

 For example, if you want to reference all pages in a book that discusses a certain topic, you have to first refer to the **index**, which lists all topics alphabetically and then refer to one or more specific page numbers.
 [Indexing in PostgreSQL.](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/postgresql/postgresql_indexes.htm)

# 9. How does indexing in MySQL differ from PostgreSQL?
**MySQL** supports B-tree and R-tree indexing that stores hierarchically indexed data.**PostgreSQL** index types include trees, expression indexes, partial indexes, and hash indexes. [MySQL vs. PostgreSQL.](https://medium.com/@hnasr/postgres-vs-mysql-5fa3c588a94e)

# 10. Relations :-
 In a relational database, each table is connected to another table using the Primary-Foreign Key constraints.
## 1- One-to-One Relation :-
  In **One-to-One relationship**, one record of the first table will be linked to zero or one record of another table. For example, each employee in the `Employee` table will have a corresponding row in `EmployeeDetails` table that stores the current passport details for that particular employee. So, each employee will have zero or one record in the `EmployeeDetails` table. This is called zero or one-to-one relationship.
  ![alt text](tables-relations5.webp)

Above, `EmployeeID` column is the primary key as well as foreign key column in the `EmployeeDetails` table that linked to `EmployeeID` of the `Employee` table. This forms zero or one-to-one relation.

 ### The following query will display data from both the tables :-
 ```SQL
 SELECT * FROM Employee
 SELECT * FROM EmployeeDetails
 ```

The following is the result of the above queries that demonstrate how each employee has none or just one corresponding record in `EmployeeDetails` table.

---
## 2- One-to-Many Relation :-
**One-to-Many** is the most commonly used relationship among tables. A single record from one table can be linked to zero or more rows in another table.

Let's take an example of the `Employee` and `Address` table in the `HR` database. The `Employee` table stores employee records where `EmployeeID` is the primary key. The `Address` table holds the addresses of employees where `AddressID` is a primary key and `EmployeeID` is a foreign key. Each employee will have one record in the `Employee` table. Each employee can have many addresses such as Home address, Office Address, Permanent address, etc.

The `Employee` and `Address` tables are linked by the key column `EmployeeID`. It is a foreign key in the `Address` table linking to the primary key `EmployeeID` in the `Employee` table. Thus, one record of the `Employee` table can point to multiple records in the `Address` table. This is a One-to-Many relationship.
![alt text](tables-relations1.webp)

### The following query will display data from both the tables :-
```SQL
SELECT * FROM Employee
SELECT * FROM Address
```
The following is the result of the above queries to demonstrate how the data is related in **one-to-many relationship**.![alt text](tables-relations2.webp)
In the above data, each record in the `Employee` table associated with zero or more records in the `Address` table, e.g. `James Bond` has zero address, `John King` has three addresses. [Relations.](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/sqlserver/tables-relations#one-to-one-relation)
